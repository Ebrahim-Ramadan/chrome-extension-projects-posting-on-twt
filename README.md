# chrome-extension-projects-posting-on-twt-
## a chrome extension to help software devs to post about their projects on twitter (mainly).
<br>

brief explanation: plenty of options show up when the user is typing for suggestions shortcuts, and the option selected get typed as default editable values on the input field itself
<br>
so the dev just fill in some info and then post
<br>
